# Rex [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RexOps/Rex.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/RexOps/Rex)

With (R)?ex you can manage all your boxes from a central point through the complete process of configuration management and software deployment.

This is the development branch for the **1.x** version tree. Use this branch if you want to 
send a bugfix or enhancement for Rex 1.x.

## Getting started

We have a [Getting started guide](http://www.rexify.org/docs/guides/start_using__r__ex.html) on the website that should help you with the first steps.

## Installation

There are several methods to install (R)?ex: use your distro's package manager, download it from CPAN or build it from source. Check out the [Get Rex](http://www.rexify.org/get.html) page on the website for the different options, and choose the one that fits you best.

### Build from source

To build (R)?ex from source, you need to install [Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla):
```
cpanm Dist::Zilla
```

Dist::Zilla provides the *dzil* command, which you can use to install (R)?ex dependencies:
```
dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm
dzil listdeps --missing | cpanm
```

Then to install (R)?ex:
```
dzil install
```

Or to build a .tar.gz release file:
```
dzil build
```

We use perltidy to help us to maintain a consequent code style throughout the project (check out our .perltidyrc for more details). We recommend setting it up with your favorite IDE or text editor, so you can apply formatting easily or even automatically to your changes before committing them.
